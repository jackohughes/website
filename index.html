Jack Hughes is a programmer and researcher working on programming language
theory, type systems, and implementations. He is currently employed as a
research associate at the University of Kent, as part of the <a href="https://research.kent.ac.uk/programming-languages-systems/">Programming Languages and Systems</a> research group. Jack's PhD thesis (available at
the <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/107798/1/67thesis.pdf">Kent Academic Repository</a>), titled "Program Synthesis from Linear and Graded
Types", explores the use of fine-grained resource constraints on types in the
context of type-directed program synthesis. As a research associate, Jack is
working on the design and implementation of a new programming language called
Spegion, which uses sized memory regions to statically enforce memory safety.
For more details please see the forthcoming ECOOP paper. A complete list of
Jack's publications can be found <a href="./publications.html">here</a>.
